This repository contains the information necessary to move in the engineering career path.

It is divided between the different levels in the following directory structure:

```

|- mid-to-senior
|- senior-to-architect
```

In each directory another ```README.md``` file describes the exercise or exercises that the developer needs to resolve and present in another to move between levels.
